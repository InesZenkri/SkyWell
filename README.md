This project is a smart, AI-powered pipeline that processes satellite weather data and personal user information to deliver **personalized alerts**. Whether it’s high pollen count or a stormy afternoon, our system ensures that users receive timely, tailored forecasts based on both environmental data and their specific sensitivities or preferences.

## 🔍 Overview

We combine **satellite data** with **user-specific health profiles** to create a system that goes beyond generic forecasts. The goal is to prevent avoidable exposure to weather-related health triggers, such as:
- High pollen levels for allergy sufferers
- Sudden temperature changes for chronic disease patients
- Air quality warnings for sensitive individuals
- .....

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Satellite and environmental data are continuously collected (e.g., temperature, pollen count, air pressure).

2. **Data Processing**  
   Raw data is filtered and structured using a preprocessing pipeline.

3. **User Input**  
   Users input personal health information such as allergies, chronic diseases, or preferences.

4. **AI Modeling**  
   An AI model processes both environmental data and user profiles to predict personalized impacts.

5. **Forecast Display**  
   General forecasts are displayed on users' mobile devices.

6. **Personalized Alerts**  
   If the AI model identifies any risk based on the user's profile, a tailored notification is sent to their mobile device.
